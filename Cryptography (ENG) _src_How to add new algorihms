Welcome! This instruction explains how to add new algorithms of decoding/encoding to this app
1. You should create package with name of algorithm
2. Created package should contain at least two classes and one GUI Form like in RC4 package.
   Also you can add your own classes to improve algorithm.
   
   Common structure of package :
   <alrorithmName> package
            (MainClass) <algorihmName> java class extends CryptoAlgorithm
            (FrameClass) <algorithmNameFrame> java class extends CrytoFrame
            <algorithmNameForm>
                    <GUI Form>
                    (FormClass) <algorithmNameForm> java class extends CryptoForm
                    
 3.MainClass defines encode/decode methods, FrameClass defines how Form communicates with MainClass, FormClass defines how user can input data
 4.To add algorithm to MainForm ComboBox, edit Recources class on createFrameMap method and CRYPTOALGORITHMS array as in examples.
